# 🚧 Traffic Accident Data Analysis & Visualization

## 💼 Task 04 – SkillCraft Technology Internship

This project is developed for **Task 04** of the **SkillCraft Data Science Internship**. The goal is to analyze traffic accident data and identify patterns based on **road conditions, weather, and time of day**. We aim to visualize **accident hotspots** and understand **contributing factors** that influence road accidents.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Analyze traffic accident statistics to explore:
  - Road conditions
  - Weather conditions
  - Time of day
- Identify high-risk patterns and accident hotspots
- Build meaningful visualizations to support data-driven road safety decisions

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset includes various fields such as:

- `Date` – Date of the accident
- `Time` – Time of occurrence
- `Location` – Accident location (region/district)
- `Weather_Condition` – Sunny, Rainy, Fog, etc.
- `Road_Condition` – Wet, Dry, Slippery, etc.
- `Accident_Severity` – Minor, Serious, Fatal
- `Vehicles_Involved`, `Casualties`, `Deaths` – Impact data

📌 **Source**: Provided accident dataset or simulated from public sources
